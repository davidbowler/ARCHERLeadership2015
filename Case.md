# Case for suppport

Stuff that needs a doing:

## Introduction ( 1 paragraph )
  - Why NWs?
  - Why doping ( w.r.t. ion implantation )?
  - Why use O(*N*) DFT?
  - What are we doing?
  
## Novelty & Timeliness
  - Reference experimental work ( esp. Fukata-san )
    - How new is this field? ( doped NWs )
    - Why do we need to carry out work like this? ( limited experimental anaylysis available )
  - Large NWs needed to remove the finite size effects of doping and stress.
  - Ion implantation used as a standard method for doping semiconductors.
  - This is a completely novel simulation (*ab-initio* has been done on the smaller scales **AND** large scale with classical molecular dynamics)
  
## Methodology
  - O(*N*) DFT
  - XL-BOMD ( cite papers Niklasson and Arita )
  - PAOs (and testing L-range? Not sure if this should go here or the later section "Basic plan")
  
## Basic plan
( This is in part covered by Dave's notes RE the timeline )
  - What will we do? 
  - How will we do it? 
  - Contingency plans
  
## Why do we need to use ARCHER?
